Hey there, I'm Aadhithya (adi). I am a Machine Learning Engineer based in Munich, Germany. My expertise lies in general computer vision (Segmentation, detection, tracking, generative modeling) and in building pipelines and tools to build, train and serve ml models at scale.

I graduated from TUM in 2020, speacialising in Deep Learning for medical imaging and explored learning disentangled features using flow-based models to generate brain mri images as a way to augment training data. Currently I work as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at hasty GmbH, where I primarily design and build pipelines to train and serve ml models at scale.

While my primary resicdence is in Munich 🥨, you can also find me in Berlin quite often. In my spare time, I like working on projects that I find fun and interesting(I've not been able to find much time for this lately... :/).

I'm always eager to learn and collaborate. Feel free to connect with me at `aadhithya.s@outlook.com` or at one of my social handles.
